# GBC Tech Challenge
Simple HTML/CSS page that is intentionally broken. The goal is to identify and fix the code. This is a real-world situation that you are likely to face in the tech industry. Be mindful that there are definite code errors and mixed syntax. 

The second part of the exercise involves creating a matching "Contact" page with a form that users can use to send a quick message.

Have fun and Good Luck!
