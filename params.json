The goal is to identify and fix the code. This is a real-world situation that you are likely to face in the tech industry. Be mindful that there are definite code errors and mixed syntax.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the exercise involves creating a matching \"Contact\" page with a form that users can use to send a quick message.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Exercise? Check out our [documentation intro](https://github.com/gbc-dev/Tech-Challenge) or contact one of our team members and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
